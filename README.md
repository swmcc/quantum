![Announce all the Tweets!!!!!!!](http://f.cl.ly/items/3d060M1c0K3v1g0T0W2F/1315118240688.jpg "Announce all the Tweets!!!!!!!")

## Description

I joined [twitter](http://www.twitter.com) on 1st March 2007, however my first [tweet](https://twitter.com/swmcc/statuses/841174273) was on the 22nd Jun 2008 and my 10,000 [tweet](https://twitter.com/swmcc/status/387510042020151296) was on the 8th October 2013.

There are probably tools out there that analyse your twitter [archive](https://blog.twitter.com/2012/your-twitter-archive) however I want to hack at this in my spare time.

This app will take my tweets and guff a json file out as json with metrics on
the crap I have spouted for the past few years. The metrics haven't been 
decided on yet but you can guess them:

- Most Mentioned Users

- Most Mentioned Hashtags

etc.

## Development Info

```
git clone git remote add origin https://github.com/swmcc/quantum.git
[get your twitter archive and] mv ~/xxxx/data data
cd quantum
./start_development # if you have tmux installed
```

## Todo

  - Add more to the app 

## Notes

This project has been in stages since October 2013. However due to an oil leak
in my house and other stuff I haven't been able to divert much attention to it.

As of March 2014 I have decided to write this in python. It is an excellent
language I have fallen in love with. I think it lends itself very well to 
data analysis.
